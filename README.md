# Matrix RSS Room Bot

A [Matrix](matrix.org) bot that creates and manages public rooms for RSS feeds.

## Why?

Most bots serve any feed in any channel; this bot serves every feed in a separate channel. This means it's most useful for:

1. Users who prefer to have separate RSS feeds in separate Matrix rooms
2. Users who wish to find other people with the same interests and discuss the topics of the RSS feed

## Potential features

Feel free to contribute! The following features would be useful to have added.

- [ ] Bot moderation channel to monitor spam
- [ ] Allow URL links with parameters if they render different RSS feeds
- [ ] User blacklist so the bot ignores misbehaving users
